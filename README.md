I am attempting to make a text editor, that is similar in use as vim. Let's see how far it goes.

## what is expected?
A comprehensive text editor with syntax highlighting and few autocompletions for general text editing.

## TODO
- absolute and relative line number
- status msg bar
    - input prompt
    - message display
    - mode indicator
    - command buffer
- text editing
- text wrap
- bufferize the editor
- vim operation modes
    - buffer modes
    - normal mode
        - movement keybinds
        - absolute and relative jumps
    - insert mode
        - editing
        - arrow based movements
