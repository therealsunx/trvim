I am attempting to make a text editor, that is similar in use as vim. Let's see how far it goes.

## what is expected?
A comprehensive text editor with syntax highlighting and few autocompletions for general text editing.

## Features
_completed features are marked with =
_undergoing features are marked with .

            - = insert mode
                - = i : cursor on left
                - = a : cursor on right
                - = I : cursor to starting character of line
                - = A : cursor to end of line
                - = o : add new line below and go to it
                - = O : add new line below but stay on current one
            - = select mode
                - = v : normal selection mode
                - = V : line selectio= mode
        - = '/' key find string
            - arrow up/down key during search to go to next/previous one
        - = f : find character after cursor
        - = F : find character before cursor
        - = r : replace character with next one
        - = $ : go to end of line
        - = 0 : go to start of line
        - = : : internal command prompt
            - = :{n} : go to line number n
            - = :w : save the current buffer into the file
            - = :wa : save all buffers into the file
            - = :q : quit current buffer
            - = :qa : quit all buffers
            - = :wq : save and quit current buffer
            - = :wqa : save and quit all buffers
            - = force quit buffers using ! at end of quit command
                - e.g. :q! force quits current buffer
        - = word navigation
            - = w : next word
            - = W : next word (ignore punctuations)
            - = b : previous word
            - = B : previous word (ignore punctuations)
            - = e : end of word
            - = E : end of word ignore punctutations
        - = paragraph navigation
            - = { : previous paragraph end
            - = } : next paragraph end
        - = absolute line jumps : {n}J : jump to line 'n'
        - = quick page navigation : fast cursor jumps for efficient work
            - = G : go to  last line of file
            - = H : move cursor towards beginning of visible page
            - = L : move cursor towards end of visible page
						- = _ : move cursor to first character in the line
        - = movement keybinds
            - h : left
            - j : down
            - k : up
            - l : right
        - = relative jumps
            - {n}(h|j|k|l) = n times (h|j|k|l)
            - e.g. 12j = jump down 12 lines
        - = command replication
            - type some number and then command to replicate it
            - e.g. relative jumps (as described above)
            - e.g. {n}w go to nth next word : 3w = go to 3rd word next to cursor 
            - e.g. {n}f{char} goes to nth next {char} character in current line
                - 3fc : go to 3rd 'c' away from cursor
            - e.g. {n}$ go to end of nth line below cursor
    - = insert mode
        - = auto indentation
        - = cursor range increase
        - = thin cursor
        - = arrow based movements
    - = visual/selection mode
				- = visual mode : select character/word-wise
				- = visual-line mode : select lines
        - = continous selection
        - = highlight selection
        - = navigation : same as normal mode(but selects items along the way) except some special keybinds
            - = Esc or Ctrl_C : switch to normal mode
            - = o or O : move cursor to different end of selection
            - = v : switch between visual and visual line mode
        - = d or x : delete selection
        - = c : cut selection (delete & switch to insert mode)
        - = r{character} : replace selection with following character
- . bufferize the editor
    - . multiple buffers
    - . buffer navigation
